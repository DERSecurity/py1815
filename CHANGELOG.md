# Changelog

Notable changes to this project, newest first. Versions follow
[semantic versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html): while the major
version is `0`, a minor bump may carry a breaking change and the release note
says so explicitly.

Nothing has been released yet. Everything below is on `main` and unversioned.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **Event buffers for classes 1, 2 and 3**, with deadbands, overflow reporting
  and confirmation handling. A deadband is measured against the last value
  *reported*, not the previous reading, so a point drifting in steps smaller
  than the deadband is still eventually reported rather than never. A quality
  change generates an event whatever its magnitude, because a point that goes
  comm-lost holding the same number has changed in the way that matters most. A
  full buffer drops its oldest event and says so.
- **Event object encoding**: the timed and untimed variations of groups 2 and
  32, the six-octet timestamp, and index-prefixed event blocks. Events are not a
  range -- they are whichever points changed, in the order they changed -- so
  each carries its own index.
- **Three more independent implementations in the interop suite**: a Rust master
  that checks the quality octet and the object variation the C++ bindings
  discard, and Wireshark and Suricata reading a capture of the whole function
  code sweep and verifying every checksum in it.

### Changed

- **A displaced connection is now aborted; a connection closed at shutdown still
  closes gracefully.** The two callers want opposite things. A displaced peer is
  typically one whose socket died without a FIN, where a graceful close waits on
  TCP retransmission -- under the admission lock, which would let a dead master
  hold the association through a second door. A master connected at shutdown is
  usually healthy, and aborting would discard a response already queued.
- **Every no-response function code is met with silence before it is parsed**,
  as the standard requires.
- Quality masks are derived from their own enum per point type, rather than one
  mask built from the analog enum and adjusted by a binary bit. The binary
  chatter-filter bit was previously covered only because it shares `0x20` with
  an analog bit.

### Fixed

- An event encoder given a timestamp for an untimed variation discarded it
  silently, so the caller believed it had sent a time and the master received an
  event without one. Both directions are now refused.
- An exception during connection admission escaped without closing the arriving
  socket, leaving a live peer the listener reported as not connected.
